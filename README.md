Problem Statement
The issue that this project is addressing is the prediction of student exam marks from factors like study hours and past scores. Academic success is determined by many different factors, and knowing these relationships can assist both educators and students in finding ways to enhance outcomes.

Key Challenges
Determining Key Factors: Not all variables that influence exam performance are readily measurable or quantifiable. This project considers two significant factors: study hours and past scores.

Data Availability: Student performance data can be noisy or limited in real-world settings. In this project, a synthetic dataset is utilized to illustrate the idea.

Model Accuracy: To construct a model that is capable of accurately forecasting exam scores, it is necessary to be meticulous about choosing features and evaluation measures.

Objectives
Explore Relationships: Visualize the correlation between study hours, past scores, and exam scores.

Predict Exam Scores: Create a machine learning model (Linear Regression) to forecast exam scores from study hours and past scores.

Evaluate Model Performance: Evaluate the accuracy of the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

Provide Insights: Utilize the model to predict new data points and give actionable insights.

Why This Problem Matters
For Educators: Facilitates the identification of students that require extra attention and the understanding of how study habits affect academic performance.

For Students: Suggests self-reflection and emphasizes the role of regular study habits.

For Institutions: Provides support for the allocation of resources and curriculum development based on students' performance trends.

Expected Outcome
At the completion of this project, we hope to:

Develop a prediction model that estimates exam scores fairly accurately.

Provide illustrations to enable stakeholders to see how study hours, past scores, and performance at exams relate.

Show the everyday application of machine learning in teaching.
